CCDrawNode Gallery
================

This solution contains an iOS and Android CocosSharp project which shows how to work with the CCDrawNode object. It includes one method for each draw function in the CCDrawNode class.

To see each draw function, open the project and navigate to the constructor in GameLayer.cs. Once there, uncomment one of the methods and run the app. The given object will be drawn to the screen.

This demo is built against CocosSharp 1.5.0.1.
