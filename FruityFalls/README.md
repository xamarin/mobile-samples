Fruity Falls
================

Fruity Falls is a full game built with CocosSharp for iOS and Android. It is a physics-based game where the player must bounce and collect fruit to earn a high score. Bouncing the fruit increases its value, and letting the fruit fall into the correctly-colored bin awards the player the points. If a piece of fruit lands in the wrong bin, then the game is over.

This game is built against CocosSharp 1.7.0.
