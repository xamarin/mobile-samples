CCAction Demo
================

This solution contains an iOS and Android CocosSharp project which shows how to work with the CCAction object. It includes usage for common implementations such as CCMove as well as many easing CCAction implementations. It also includes a custom CCAction implementation for changing the visual objectâ€™s line width.

This demo is built against CocosSharp 1.5.0.1.
