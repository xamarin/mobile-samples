Bluetooth LE Explorer
=====================

Bluetooth LE Explorer is a cross-platform app that lets you scan for nearby 
Bluetooth Low Energy devices, connect to them, enumerate their services, and 
then enumerate those service characteristics.

<div style="color:red"><b>WARNING: This code has been deprecated.</b></div> There is a newer version in [Monkey.Robotics Platform Stacks](https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.Robotics/tree/master/Source/Platform%20Stacks) (see the `Robotics.Mobile` projects). The Bluetooth LE stack is now available via the [Monkey.Robotics Component](https://components.xamarin.com/view/Monkey.Robotics) and there is a [sample 'Explorer app'](https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/BluetoothTISensor) that uses the component, written with Xamarin.Forms.
