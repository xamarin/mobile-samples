Phoneword
=========

Very simple example of sharing c# code across four platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8. 
Also includes a command-line version as a 'test harness'.

App functionality is to convert telephone number 'words' into digits (eg 1-800-FLOWERS to the actual phone number).
