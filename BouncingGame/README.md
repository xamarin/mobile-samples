CocosSharp BouncingGame Project for iOS and Android
====================================

This is a small, complete game using CocosSharp for iOS and Android.  It is the result of working through the the entire Introduction to CocosSharp walkthrough.

This game is built against CocosSharp 1.7.1.0.

The game can be played by touching the screen to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen horizontally.  The goal is to keep the ball from falling off-screen.  Each bounce awards the player one point.
