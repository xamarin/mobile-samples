Tasky
=====

Tasky is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo/task items.

Tasky supports iOS and Android - each with a native UI written in C#.
It uses a local SQLite database to store the tasks, which are saved and read with SQL.

Common code lives in a [Shared Project](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/), which is referenced by each application project.
This project type requires Xamarin 3 (Xamarin Studio 5.x) or Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 (which supports the Shared Asset Project project-type).
It is compatible with the free Starter Edition of Xamarin.

Xamarin.Forms Version
---------------------
The equivalent app written with [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms) is
called [Todo](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/Todo).
