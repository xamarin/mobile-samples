CCRenderTexture Example Project
================

This solution contains an iOS and Android CocosSharp project which shows how to work with the CCRenderTexture object. This app highlights the performance benefits of using CCRenderTexture in certain situations. It also shows how CCRenderTexture can be used to apply transparency to an entire entity.

The `useRenderTarget` and `opacity` variables can be modified to see the impact of CCRenderTexture.

This demo is built using CocosSharp 1.7.1.
