RazorTodo
=========

This sample is a simple Todo list application. It has two screens:

* Todo list
* Todo detail view

Both these screens are rendered as HTML which is build from Razor templates.

The application is not heavily styled but all the HTML styling tools you are familiar with are available, including regular CSS, JQuery Mobile or other frameworks.
