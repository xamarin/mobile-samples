RazorTodo
=========

Razor is an HTML templating engine for .NET that works on Xamarin.

Using the web view controls on iOS and Android you can create HTML-based user interfaces that have been generated from Razor templates.

The **RazorTodo** sample uses Razor templates to render all the application screens using HTML.

The **RazorNativeTodo** sample uses a *native* list view on each platform and Razor to render the detail view using HTML.
