RazorNativeTodo
=========

This sample is a simple Todo list application. It has two screens:

* Todo list
* Todo detail view

The list screen is rendered using native controls on each platform:

* iOS uses UITableView
* Android uses ListView

When a row is selected in the list, the detail view is rendered using a Razor template.

The application is not heavily styled but all the HTML styling tools you are familiar with are available, including regular CSS, JQuery Mobile or other frameworks.
