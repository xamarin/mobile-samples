Business Layer (BL)
===================
Sometimes also called the Business Logic Layer (BLL), the BL contains entitiy definitions and 
business logic.

Business Entities
-----------------
Business entites are classes that represent real-world objects. They're the core of 
Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP).

Manager Classes
---------------
In this particular architecture, we're using the fa√ßade pattern (like we did with the DAL) 
which is represented by static Manager classes. The manager classes are an abstraction on 
the DAL and SAL layers and perform any business logic.
