Data Access Layer (DAL)
=======================
The data access layer is responsible for providing an abstraction to the data layer. It makes 
sure that no matter what technology(ies) are used for data persistance, a single entry point 
that is technology agnostic exists.

Often, the fa√ßade pattern is used, and many times the underlying data persistence technology is
actually more than one. for example, you might have some data store in xml, other data stored in 
a SQL database, etc. The DAL makes sure that any complexity associated with accessing and aggregating
these technologies is isolated from the rest of the application.

The DAL is also considered a sibling to the Service Access Layer (SAL), which is responsible for
access to cloud services, and other network related resources.
