Background Location Demo
================

This is a cross platform sample, which demonstrates how to properly perform location updates while the application is either Active or Backgrounded.

Location data will be displayed on the screen when the app is running in the foreground, and in the application output when the app is operating in the background.

This sample also demonstrates the final application produced in the [Using Background Location (iOS)](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/backgrounding/part_4_ios_backgrounding_walkthroughs/location_walkthrough/) and [Backgrounding in Android](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/backgrounding/part_8_android_backgrounding_walkthrough/) walkthroughs.
