Coin Time
================

Coin Time is a full game built on CocosSharp for iOS and Android. It is a platformer where the player must collect all coins in a level, then reach the exist before time runs out. If the player dies, either by running out of time or by touching an enemy or spike, then the level restarts.

The game's levels are created using [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/ "Tiled").

This game is built against CocosSharp 1.5.0.
